## 4. Healthcare Systems

### 4.1 Define Health Disparity
 
> Health disparities are preventable differences in the burden of disease, injury, violence, or opportunities to achieve optimal health that are experienced by socially 
> disadvantaged populations. Populations can be defined by factors such as race or ethnicity, gender, education or income, disability, geographic location (e.g., rural or 
> urban), or sexual orientation. Health disparities are inequitable and are directly related to the historical and current unequal distribution of social, political, economic, 
> and environmental resources. - CDC

1. National health insurance (NHI)—A tax-supported national health care program in which services are financed by the government but are rendered by private providers (e.g., Canada).
2. National health system (NHS)—A tax-supported national health care program in which the government finances and also controls the service infrastructure (e.g., Great Britain).
3. Socialized health insurance (SHI)—Health care is financed through government-mandated contributions by employers and employees. Health care is delivered by private providers (e.g., Germany).
