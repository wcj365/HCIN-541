- Emergence

## 4 Healthcare Systems

### 4.1 Global Diversity of Healthcare Systems

- US
- Europe

### 4.2 Different Approaches to Healthcare

## 5. Define Culture and its Influence on Healthcare System

### 5.1 What is Culture

- "the way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time" - Cambridge Dictionary
- "the customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a racial, religious, or social group.
also : the characteristic features of everyday existence (such as diversions or a way of life) shared by people in a place or time" - Merriam Webster
- "Simply said, culture is how you were raised. It developed while you grew up. With a computer metaphor, culture is the software of our minds. We need shared software in order to communicate. So culture is about what we share with those around us.
In action in social life, culture constitutes the unwritten rules of the social game." - Hofstede 

### 5.2 Hofstede's 6D Model of National Culture

1. Power Distance Index (PDI)
2. Individualism vs Collectivism (IDV)
3. Masculinity vs Femininity (MAS)
4. Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI)
5. Long-Term Orientation (LTO) vs Short-Term Orientation (STO)
6. Indulgence vs Restraint (IVR)

## 6. Sumary

- Health is the state of holistic wellbeing, its determinants are multi-faceted, and its care requires a systemic and balanced approach.
- Healthcare is complex process involving multiple disciplines and stakeholders with diverse perspectives and interests.
- Healthcare policies seeks to optimize resource utilization and enable the collaborative effort by all stakeholders to prevent, diagnose, cure, and manage diseases and to promote healthy life styles and equitable healthcare. 
- Use data to help understand the problems and support informed evidence-based decision making

*To transform healthcare is to seek balance. A System approach is a balanced multiple-perspective approach.*
- Physical - Mental
- Dianosis - Prevention
- Treatment (acute conditions) - Management (chronic conditions)
- Behaviroal - Socioeconomic
- illness - wellness
- biological - psychological
- inpatient - outpatient
- independent institutions - integrated and collaborative systems
- individual health - population health
- fee-for-service - performance/outcome based

## 7. Looking Ahead - How this course is organizaed

### 7.1. System Resources 

This part covers the "*Structure*" aspect of the Donabedian Model. I describes the system resources that are required to deliver healthcare services:

- Health Services Professionals (People)
- Medical Technologgy (Technology)
- Health Services Financing (Money)

### 7.2. System Process

This part also covers the "*Structure*" aspect of the Donabedian Model. It describes the system structure in which healthcare is delivered:
- Outpatient and primary care services (clinics)
- Inpatient Facilities and Services (hospitals)
- Managed Care and Integrated Organizations
- Long-Term Care
- Health Services for Special Populations

### 7.3. System Outcome

This part covers the "*Outcomes*" aspect of the Donabedian Model. 
- Costs
- Access
- Quality

Note: the "Process" aspect of Donabedian model is about how healthcare is delivered. It centers around the activities performed by healthcare professionals for individual patients (micro). It is not covered in this course since this course is about population health (macro).
